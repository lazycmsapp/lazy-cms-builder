# Device Visibility

Every element in Lazy Builder has visibility controls to show or hide it on specific devices.

## How It Works

In any element's **General** tab, you'll find the **Element Visibility** row:

```
[ 🖥 Desktop ] [ 📱 Tablet ] [ 📲 Mobile ]
```

- **Button highlighted (solid)** → visible on that device
- **Button dimmed (outline)** → hidden on that device

Click a button to toggle visibility.

## Examples

### Show on desktop only
```
[ ✅ Desktop ] [ ❌ Tablet ] [ ❌ Mobile ]
```
Use for complex data tables or large images that don't work on small screens.

### Show on mobile only
```
[ ❌ Desktop ] [ ❌ Tablet ] [ ✅ Mobile ]
```
Use for a compact mobile navigation or a "Call Now" button.

### Hide on mobile
```
[ ✅ Desktop ] [ ✅ Tablet ] [ ❌ Mobile ]
```
Use to simplify layouts on small screens by removing decorative elements.

## Container & Column Visibility

Visibility controls also exist at the **Container** and **Column** level (in their respective settings panels). This lets you:

- Show an entirely different layout section per device
- Have a desktop sidebar column that doesn't appear on mobile
- Use a mobile-only full-width column in place of a multi-column desktop layout

## Implementation

Visibility is applied via Tailwind CSS classes (`hidden`, `md:block`, `lg:block`) generated from the visibility settings. No JavaScript required — pure CSS responsive hiding.
