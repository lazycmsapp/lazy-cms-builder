# Roles & Permissions

Lazy CMS includes a full Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Every user has a role, and every role has a set of permissions.

## Built-in Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Super Admin** | Bypasses all permission checks. Full access to everything. |
| **Administrator** | Full access to all settings, content, and configurations. |
| **Editor** | Can publish and manage all posts, pages, and media. Can moderate comments. |
| **Author** | Can publish and manage **only their own** posts. |
| **Contributor** | Can write posts but **cannot publish** them (pending review). |
| **Subscriber** | Access to their own profile and basic dashboard view. |

## Managing Roles

Go to **Admin → Roles** to:
- Create custom roles
- Assign permissions to roles
- Edit or delete existing roles

## Checking Permissions in Code

The `HasCmsPermissions` trait is automatically added to your `User` model during installation.

```php
$user = auth()->user();

// Check role
if ($user->hasRole('editor')) {
    // Editor-specific logic
}

// Check multiple roles (returns true if user has any)
if ($user->hasRole(['editor', 'author'])) {
    // ...
}

// Check a specific permission
if ($user->hasPermission('manage_posts')) {
    // ...
}

// Check if user has any of the given permissions
if ($user->hasAnyPermission(['manage_posts', 'manage_pages'])) {
    // ...
}

// Check if user has ALL permissions
if ($user->hasAllPermissions(['manage_posts', 'manage_media'])) {
    // ...
}
```

## Checking in Blade Templates

```blade
@if(auth()->user()->hasRole('administrator'))
    <a href="/admin/settings">Settings</a>
@endif

@if(auth()->user()->hasPermission('manage_posts'))
    <button>New Post</button>
@endif
```

## Assigning Permissions Programmatically

```php
$user = User::find(1);

// Give a permission directly to a user (not via role)
$user->givePermission('manage_posts');

// Revoke a permission
$user->revokePermission('manage_posts');
```

## Content Ownership

Authors and Contributors can only see and edit **their own content**. This isolation is enforced at the controller level — they cannot access or modify other users' posts even if they try to navigate directly to the URL.

## IP Blacklist

Administrators can block specific IP addresses from logging in:
- **Admin → Users → Blacklist** — View and remove blocked IPs
- Blocked users see an error on login attempt

## API Token Authentication

For REST API access:
1. Go to **Admin → Settings → API**
2. Click **Generate Token**
3. Use the token as a `Bearer` header:

```http
GET /api/v1/posts
Authorization: Bearer your-api-token-here
```
