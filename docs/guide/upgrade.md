# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading to a New Version

```bash
# 1. Update the package
composer update lazycmsapp/lazy-cms-builder

# 2. Run the update command
php artisan lazy:update
```

`lazy:update` handles everything automatically:
- Runs new database migrations
- Syncs permissions and roles
- Refreshes admin assets (CSS, JS)
- Refreshes the default theme
- Publishes child theme skeleton (non-destructive — never overwrites your customizations)
- Clears application cache
- Auto-creates any missing e-commerce pages

::: tip Child theme safety
`lazy:update` will **never** overwrite files in your child theme. Your customizations in `resources/views/themes/my-child-theme/` are always preserved.

## CLI Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `php artisan lazy` | Show all Lazy CMS commands |
| `php artisan lazy:install` | Full fresh install |
| `php artisan lazy:update` | Update assets, migrations, and permissions |
| `php artisan lazy:seed` | Seed default menus and demo content |
| `php artisan lazy:publish-scheduled` | Manually publish due scheduled posts |
| `php artisan make:lazy-page {Name}` | Scaffold a new admin dashboard page |

## Scaffolding a Custom Admin Page

```bash
php artisan make:lazy-page Analytics
```

Creates:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AnalyticsController.php`
- `resources/views/admin/analytics/index.blade.php`
- Route entry in your routes file
- Sidebar menu item

## Scheduled Tasks

Lazy CMS auto-registers a scheduled task via Laravel's scheduler. Ensure your cron is set up:

```bash
# crontab -e
* * * * * cd /path/to/app && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

This runs `lazy:publish-scheduled` every minute to auto-publish scheduled posts.

If you can't set up cron, Lazy CMS also auto-publishes as a **terminating callback** after every web request — so scheduled posts publish on the next page load after their scheduled time.

## Backups

Always back up before upgrading:

1. Go to **Admin → Tools → Backup**
2. Click **Create Backup**
3. Download the backup file
4. Then run `composer update` and `lazy:update`

If something goes wrong, restore from backup:
1. **Admin → Tools → Backup → Upload** your backup file
2. Click **Restore**

## WordPress Migration

Import content from a WordPress site:

1. Go to **Admin → Tools → WordPress Import**
2. Export your WordPress content as XML (`wp-admin → Tools → Export`)
3. Upload the XML file
4. Optionally: import media files
5. All posts, pages, categories, tags, and users are imported

## REST API

Lazy CMS includes a REST API for headless use.

### Enable API

1. **Admin → Settings → API**
2. Toggle **Enable REST API**
3. Click **Generate Token**
