# Post Types

Lazy CMS has three layers of content types:

1. **Built-in types** — Posts, Pages, Products (hardcoded, always available)
2. **Custom Post Types** — Created from Admin → Post Types
3. **Advanced Custom Post Types (ACPT)** — Full featured CPTs with custom fields and taxonomies

## Built-in Post Types

### Pages
Static pages with full builder support. Each page can use a template and the drag-and-drop builder.

- **Admin:** Admin → Pages
- **Frontend URL:** `/{slug}` (e.g., `/about-us`)
- **Builder:** Full Lazy Builder support

### Posts
Blog posts with categories, tags, comments, and scheduling.

- **Admin:** Admin → Posts
- **Frontend URL:** `/blog/{slug}` or `/{slug}` depending on permalink setting
- **Features:** Categories, Tags, Revisions, Scheduling, Comments, Author

### Products
E-commerce products. Managed under Admin → Products.

- **Frontend URL:** `/products/{slug}`
- **Features:** Product Categories, Product Tags, Variable Products, Pricing, Inventory

## Custom Post Types

Create simple CPTs from the admin — no code required.

### Creating a Custom Post Type

1. Go to **Admin → Post Types**
2. Click **Add New**
3. Enter: Name, Slug, Icon (FontAwesome class)
4. Save

The new CPT appears instantly in the sidebar under its own menu.

### Accessing CPT Content

```php
// Get posts of a custom type
$projects = get_lazy_posts([
    'type'  => 'project',  // your CPT slug
    'limit' => 10,
]);

foreach ($projects as $post) {
    echo $post->title;
    echo get_lazy_permalink($post);
}
```

### CPT Frontend URLs
CPT posts resolve at `/{type}/{slug}` — e.g., `/project/my-first-project`.

## Advanced Custom Post Types (ACPT)

ACPT gives you full control: custom taxonomies, custom fields, field groups, and more.

### Creating an ACPT

1. Go to **Admin → ACPT**
2. Click **Add New**
3. Configure: Name, Slug, Icon, Supports (title, content, excerpt, thumbnail)
4. Save

### Adding Custom Taxonomies to an ACPT

After creating the ACPT:
1. Go to **Admin → ACPT → Taxonomies**
2. Attach to your CPT, set Singular/Plural names and Slug

### Adding Custom Fields

1. Go to **Admin → ACPT → Fields**
2. Create a Field Group (e.g., "Project Details")
3. Add fields: text, textarea, select, checkbox, radio, number, date, color, image, etc.

### Reading Custom Fields in Templates

```php
// Single field
$deadline = get_custom_field($post, 'deadline');

// All fields (keyed array)
$fields = get_post_custom_fields($post);
echo $fields['deadline'];
echo $fields['client_name'];
```

## Post Status Flow

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Not public, work in progress |
| `pending` | Awaiting editor review |
| `published` | Live and visible |
| `scheduled` | Auto-publishes at `published_at` time |
| `private` | Only visible to logged-in admins |
| `trash` | Soft-deleted, recoverable |

### Scheduling Posts

Set a future `published_at` datetime — the status automatically changes to `scheduled`. Lazy CMS runs `lazy:publish-scheduled` every minute to auto-publish due posts.

You can also trigger it manually:

```bash
php artisan lazy:publish-scheduled
```

---

## Revisions

Every time you save a post, a revision is created. To view revisions:

1. Open any post/page in the editor
2. Click **Revisions** in the sidebar
3. Compare versions side-by-side
4. Click **Restore** to revert

Revisions support both the Classic editor and the Lazy Builder.
