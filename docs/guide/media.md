# Media Library

The Media Library handles all file uploads: images, videos, and documents.

## Uploading Files

**Admin → Media → Add New**

- Drag and drop files or click to browse
- Supports: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, MP4, PDF, and more
- Multiple files can be uploaded at once

## Managing Media

**Admin → Media** shows all uploaded files in a grid or list view.

Click any file to:
- Edit **Alt text** (important for SEO and accessibility)
- Edit **Title** and **Caption**
- Get the **direct URL**
- **Delete** the file

## Bulk Operations

Select multiple files and:
- **Bulk Delete** — Remove multiple files at once
- **Bulk Optimize** — Compress images to reduce file size

## Using Media in Content

### In the Editor
Click the **Image** button in any content field or click **Featured Image** to open the media picker.

### In Builder Elements
Image, Gallery, and Video elements all have media picker buttons that open the library.

### In Code

```php
use Acme\CmsDashboard\Models\Media;

// Get all media
$images = Media::where('type', 'image')->latest()->get();

foreach ($images as $media) {
    echo $media->url;        // Full URL
    echo $media->filename;   // "photo.jpg"
    echo $media->alt;        // Alt text
    echo $media->size;       // File size in bytes
    echo $media->mime_type;  // "image/jpeg"
}

// Get the featured image of a post
$post = get_lazy_post('my-post');
echo $post->featured_image;  // URL string
```

## Storage

Files are stored in Laravel's `storage/app/public/` directory and served via the `storage` symlink.

If uploads aren't working, run:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```
