# Introduction

**Lazy CMS Builder** is a full-featured, WordPress-inspired CMS package for Laravel. Drop it into any Laravel app and get a complete admin dashboard with a drag-and-drop page builder, e-commerce, multi-language support, and much more — in minutes.

## Why Lazy CMS Builder?

Most Laravel CMS solutions are either too simple or require you to rebuild everything from scratch. Lazy CMS Builder gives you a production-ready foundation:

- **No separate installation** — it's a Composer package, lives inside your Laravel app
- **Full admin dashboard** — pages, posts, custom post types, menus, media, users, settings
- **Lazy Builder** — a visual drag-and-drop page builder (think Elementor, but for Laravel)
- **E-commerce ready** — shop, cart, checkout, orders, coupons out of the box
- **Extensible** — WordPress-like hooks let you customize everything without modifying core files

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| PHP | 8.1+ |
